"""Internal planners for bounded-memory loading.

Not part of the public API: the entry points are
``ParallelLoader(max_batch_bytes=..., device_memory_budget=...)``.

plan_chunks partitions one shard into byte-budgeted sub-file chunks; the
fit planner below turns a whole-load device memory budget into per-file
chunk budgets.


Given the byte sizes of every (kept) tensor -- all known upfront from
safetensors headers -- and a total ``device_memory_budget`` the load may
occupy at peak, compute a per-file chunk budget so that

    resident_bytes + live_transient_buffers <= budget

holds at every moment of the load. Budgets are large while cumulative
resident bytes are small (whole-file loads, no chunking overhead) and
decline only as the device fills, so chunking cost is paid only where the
fit actually requires it. The plan is precomputed and deterministic: same
files, same filter, same budget -> same plan. There is no runtime feedback.

Why per-file budgets are safe (the bound): while any chunk of file ``i`` is
alive, resident bytes are at most ``R[i+1]`` (only tensors of files ``<= i``
have been materialized; file i's kept bytes are charged up front) and every
live transient buffer belongs to file ``i`` or a later file ``j > i``. The
per-file budget ``B`` declines monotonically with ``R``, so every live
buffer span is ``<= B[i]``. With at most ``depth`` buffers alive,

    peak <= R[i+1] + depth * B[i] <= budget      (by choice of B[i]).

    consumers whose destination memory is already allocated before the load
    (e.g. copying into preallocated model parameters): resident growth is 0
    and the plan degenerates to a uniform budget of ``budget / depth``.

    ``transient_multiplier`` scales the per-buffer transient cost. On the
    O_DIRECT reader path each in-flight chunk costs ~1x its span plus a small
    fixed thread-pool (measured on GB10 unified memory: +~150 MB regardless of
    chunk size, covered by the auto-budget reserve), so 1 is correct even on
    unified-memory systems. The mmap+pin_memory fallback additionally pins the
    chunk's file pages for the copy's lifetime -- on unified memory that draws
    from the same physical pool as the device buffer, so each in-flight chunk
    costs ~2x its span: pass 2 when the fallback will be used (see
    ``unified.chunk_transient_multiplier``).

    Returns one budget per file; feed each to
